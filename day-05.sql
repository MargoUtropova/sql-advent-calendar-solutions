-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

select e.elf_id, elf_name,
CASE
  when v.return_date is not null then v.return_date
  else "Still resting"
  end as return_date
from elves as e
left join vacations as v
using(elf_id)
