-- Difficulty: hard

-- Question:
-- The Grinch has brainstormed a ton of pranks for Whoville, but he only wants to keep the top prank per target, with the highest evilness score. Return the most evil prank for each target. If two pranks have the same evilness, the more recently brainstormed wins.

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: grinch_prank_ideas
--   prank_id: INTEGER
--   target_name: VARCHAR
--   prank_description: VARCHAR
--   evilness_score: INTEGER
--   created_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

select prank_id, target_name, prank_description, evilness_score, created_at from (select *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY target_name ORDER BY evilness_score desc, created_at desc) AS max_rating
from grinch_prank_ideas) as t
where max_rating = 1
